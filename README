DESCRIPTION
This is a simple countdown tool to demonstrate installable web app functionality
in Google Chrome, both a packaged and a hosted edition.

The tutorial was originally presented when Chrome apps were in development,
and it was possible for an app to also include a browser/page action. Thus, 
the packaged app demo is slightly out of date. Caveat emptor!
